This was a project during Udemy course made by Jonas Schmedtmann
------------------------------------------------------------------

I was given HTML and CSS files and I applied logic with javaScript. I was doing it along with Jonas but I used my solutions to solve some problems and tried to make it my way so I can learn js better. Hope it works fine for everyone and that's all that matters :)

Just wanted to clarify that it's not fully done by me.
